# CEP146-NAA - 2025 Fall - Project 1

## Objective
In a group, students will research and present (via a short video) a recent or ongoing current 
topic/event related to software development. The goal is to demonstrate understanding of 
contemporary topics, improve research and communication skills, and utilize GitHub for 
collaborative project development and material organization.

## Due Date
- Please update the main README.md file with group member information as soon as possible.
- Presentations are due before the start of class (12:35 PM) on Tuesday, October 14.

## Project Requirements

| Item                    | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Topic**               | Any **current** topic related to **software development/programming** (e.g., new programming languages, software engineering trends, major software company news, emerging tools, or ethical challenges in AI). Avoid hardware-related topics! |
| **Team Size**           | 3–5 students per group (4 recommended) |
| **Presentation Format** | Pre-recorded **YouTube video** (Time: **2:30–3:00 minutes** - Note that 3:00 minutes is a **hard limit** and submissions over the limit will be rejected!) |
| **Presentation Style**  | Freestyle: Use any method (e.g., live recording, PowerPoint voiceover, screen recording) <br>**Note**: No AI-generated voices or video allowed |
| **GitHub Use**          | All project work (scripts, slides, media assets, documentation, etc.) must be uploaded to **GitHub**. Collaboration history (commits, issues, pull requests) will be assessed. |
| **Attribution**         | All referenced sources must be cited in your video and in your repository, using a standard format (such as APA or MLA) |
| **Grading Breakdown**   | Total: **10% of final grade** for Presentation + GitHub collaboration |

## Deliverables Checklist

All items must be committed via the group’s GitHub repository, :

- [ ]  Main README.md file, containing a table with four columns and one row per student in the group:
GitHub User ID, Full Name, Student Number, and Seneca E-mail address
- [ ] Research notes or draft write-up
- [ ] Video script or outline
- [ ] Visual slide deck(s) (if used)
- [ ] Final video YouTube link (place this in the main README.md file)
- [ ] Evidence of collaboration (issues, commits, pull requests, etc.)

## Grading Breakdown (Total 10%)

### Group Presentation – 10%

| Criteria | Weight | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Content Accuracy & Depth** | 2% | Topic is relevant, well-researched, and reflects understanding of the current event in software development. |
| **Clarity & Creativity of Presentation** | 2% | Video is engaging, within time limit, clear delivery. Freestyle encouraged (e.g., live, slides, animations). |
| **GitHub Usage & Collaboration** | 2% | Proper use of GitHub (commits from all members, readme, issues, collaboration). Evidence of shared work. |
| **Structure** | 2% | Clear structure (intro-body-conclusion), ends with a meaningful question for audience reflection. |
| **Technical Quality (Editing & Delivery)** | 2% | Video/audio is clear and watchable. Not overly dependent on one speaker. Good pacing. |

## GitHub Best Practices for the Project

- Use the `README.md` file as an index/guide to the other files in the repository. Make sure it includes at least:
  - The table of students
  - Link to YouTube video
- Use GitHub Issues to track tasks (e.g., script writing, editing, voiceover).
- Use folders to organize different types of assets (scripts, graphics, and so forth).
- Assign roles clearly and document contributions, via commits and Issues (including comments on Issues).
- Commit and push regularly – avoid a single last-minute upload.
- Create branches and use pull requests as appropriate.
- **Important:** Don't forget to acknowledge and cite your sources.

## Submission Format

- GitHub repository with all project materials.
- Public YouTube video link embedded in the `README.md`
