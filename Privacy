*Privacy*

**What is Privacy**
According to Rijmenam, privacy is the right to keep personal information/data confidential and free from unauthorized access. The right to privacy is important because it helps us maintain individual autonomy which allows us to have dignigty and uphold personal and professional relationships. It also keeps us safe from things like fraud, identity theft, scams, and physical or emotional harm.

**The Problem**
The ethical issue with AI and privacy, is that AI uses your personal data to manipualte, track and influence your actions. On a surface level this isn't all bad, since we get things like targeted ads which are ads that are specifically made for us to view based on our interests and recent activities online.
However, this also means that with our data, AI makes subtle decisions that humans don't recognize.
Our data can be exploited and mishandled by anyone with access, which can lead to cyberbullying, and online harrassment.
AI also relys on our data to generate answers and make decisions. If the system is collecting data and being trained from racist, sexist, and prejudinced content from humans, then it can produce discriminatory and unfair results that can harm individuals. For example, an AI model used at a hiring company may be prejudidced against candidates, based on discriminatory factors.

**A Solution**
When used the right way, AI can actually help imporve how private data is handled, as it can filter through sensitive information and only provide neccessary data to humans knowledge and use.
So how can this be used in the right way:
1. collection limitation: There should be a limit on the type of personal data that is collected.
2. Use limitation: The data collected should only be used for the inteded purpose and nothing else, with
3. Puroose Specification: Individuals should be notified of the purpose of data collection and also given the choice to give their data or not.

**Takeaway**
A balance between technological advancement and privacy regulations will furuther improve the development of socially responsibel AI that can help improve society's well-being in the longterm.
